# iDMET: Network-based approach for integrating differential analysis of cancer metabolomics

## Requirement
 
* igraph
* cytoscape


## Description
* Data files
  * Dataset1 : 5 studies (data matrix of metabolome profile)
  * Dataset2 : 27 studies(ratio data) 
  
  The 27 data sets were divided into two datasets: the first data (Dataset1) sets was used for comparison with ex-isting methods, and the second data sets (Dataset2) was used for testing and evaluation of our methodology.

* Annoation list (metabodic.csv)
  * Annotation list presents the information in an organized fashion, collecting common metabolite names and their synonyms.
