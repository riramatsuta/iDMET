# iDMET: Network-based approach for integrating differential analysis of cancer metabolomics

## Requirement
 
* igraph
* cytoscape


## Description
* Dataset
  * Dataset1 : 5 raw metabolome data files
  * Dataset2 : 27 studies(ratio data) 
  
  The 27 data sets were divided into two datasets: the first data(Dataset1) sets was used for comparison with ex-isting methods, and the second data sets(Dataset2) was used for testing and evaluation of our methodology.

* Annoation list
